1. corp_dict.R

        + uses files2sentences() to create a corpus split into one-sentence documents from several files
        + tokenizes it into words
        + removes weird words
        + creates unigram frequency table that can be used for EDA and to define dictionary
        + creates dict as character vector
2. buildNgrams.R

        + creates a list (1-max_n)-gram frequency tables, using clean set of tokens (takes a while)
        + replaces out-of-dictionary words with <UNK>
        + recalculates all n-gram frequencies
3. Katz.R

        + my_cond() is a helper function to create logical conditions(X1=.. and X2=.. etc)
        + find_ngram() is also a helper function that tells whether a ngram is observed, and if yes, then its count or percentage
        + estimates probability of a n-gram, given frequency table:
                + for observed ngrams, returns c*/c 
                + for unobserved ngrams,...
